This should take 15 seconds at the most depending on your internet connection speed.\n-   Do not reload the page as progress made is not recorded.\n-   Remember to load your packages, if it doesn't load, you can always install them.\n-   You have forty minutes to answer the questions.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n-   **Do not reload the page.**\n-   **The pipe shortcut might not work. You'll need to input it manually.**\n-   Use %>% or |> to pipe.\n:::\n\n **Good luck!!**\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| context: setup\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"car\", \"skimr\", \"janitor\"))\nurl <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/bootcamp-test/master/data/inventory_data.csv\"\ndownload.file(url, \"inventory_data.csv\")\n```\n\n# Question 1.\n\nThere's a csv file named **\"inventory_data.csv\"**, import the file correctly, give it a variable name of your choice and print the last 6 observations\n\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n# Question 2.\n\nUsing any appropriate R function print the variable names of the file you just imported.\n\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n# Question 3.\n\nWhat is the correlation between `area_ha` and `volume_m3_ha`.\n\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n# Question 3b.\n\nIs the data positively or negatively correlated?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.webr .cell-code}\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# Question 4.\n\nFilter the data to return trees that have a the **minimum age** of **140**. With your result, plot a graph of `area_ha` on the **x-axis** and `volume_m3_ha` on the **y-axis**, and color / fill by species. \n\n:::{.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n-   The type of graph to draw is up to you.\n-   Do not forget to use **+** instead of |> to combine plots elements after calling `ggplot()`\n:::\n\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n# Question 4b.\n\nWhich species is having the highest volume from the result of your graph?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.webr .cell-code}\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Question 5.\n\nFind the mean increment for each tree species. Arrange your result in descending order of mean increment.\n\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n# Question 6.\n\nFrom the result above, what species is having the highest mean increment? Show this graphically and change the fill color(s) with a color of your choosing. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nDo not return the default color. You must choose a color.\n:::\n\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n\n# Question 7.\n\nProduce a box plot for the volume of each species.\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n# Question 7b.\n\nIs the above graph a good representation of the volume of the trees?\n\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n# Question 8.\n\nDraw a line graph of `volume_m3_ha` **vs** `age_max`. Color the lines with species\n```{webr-r}\n```\n\n# Question 8b.\n\nWhat can you deduce from the line graph?\n\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n# Question 9.\n\nDraw a line graph of `volume_m3_ha` vs `age_max`. Color the lines with species and let each species have their own plots.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n-   `volume_m3_ha` in y-axis and `age_max` in x-axis\n-   The `facet_wrap()` function might be something to consider.\n:::\n\n\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n# Question 10.\n\nCreate a new variable named `mean_age`. The data of `mean_age` is the average of `age_max` and `age_min`. \n\n```{webr-r}\n```",
