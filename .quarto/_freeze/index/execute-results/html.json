Ideally it takes less than a seconds. You have twenty minutes to answer the questions. Do not reload the page. If you, you lose your progress. **Good luck!!**\n\n# Questions\n\n1. create a vector of even numbers from 200 to 400 and save it in a variable called `my_even_number`. Print your result\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n2. How many even numbers do we have in `my_even_number`\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n3. create a vector of odd numbers from 30 to 108 and save it in a variable called `my_odd_number`\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n4. what is the median of `my_odd_number`\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n5. what is the average of `my_even_number`\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n6. Using R, find the remainder of 498 divided by 5\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n7. Change the word **greatest** from lower case to upper case.\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n8. Get the total value if you add `my_even_number`and `my_odd_number`\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n9. create a sequence of number from -10 to 10. and save it in the variable name `my_number`. Confirm if `my_number` data type is a character data type\n```{webr-r}\n\n\n```\n\n10. If your answer in the previous is **TRUE** find the sum, else convert it to a character type\n```{webr-r}\n\n```\n\n",
