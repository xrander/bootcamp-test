# Project Overview
Students will apply the skills learned throughout the bootcamp to analyze a dataset from any of the two data provided below. They will use R to understand their data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), inferential statistics, and data visualization. The final output will include a final report written using Quarto and rendered to pdf and html. A sample report is available at [here](https://blog.olamideadu.com/posts/possum%20regression/). The assignment is to be submitted on your Github account on a repository called **r-for-research-capstone-project**.

# The Data

## Project I $CO_2$ Emission from Cereal Food Production
![Rice farmers- source: linkedin.com](images/rice_farmers.jpeg){width="450"}

This data is an extract from @owid-carbon-deforestation-trade. It presents the emission from converting forest land to rice, wheat, and other cereal products for different countries. The data for this project is available here [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/bootcamp-test/master/data/emission_data.csv).

This data contains the following columns:

|**Variable**|**Meaning**|
|----|----|
|entity|Country name|
|code|The country code|
|products|The cereal food|
|emission|Total $CO_2$ emission in tonnes|
|per_capita_emission|Deforestation emission per person|

**Objectives:**

- Import your data
- convert emission from tonnes to kilotonne.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize data using appropriate plots.
- Perform inferential statistical analysis to see if there's a difference in emission between the products.
- Communicate findings in a report.

## Project II  Cuckoo Eggs Dimension

The data for this project is from the DAAG package by @maindonald2015package. It presents measurement on 120 eggs lain in the nest of 6 different species of cuckoos. The data for this project is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xrander/bootcamp-test/master/data/cuckoo.csv).

This data contains the following columns:

|**Variable**|**Meaning**|
|-----|-----|
|length|The length of eggs in millimeters|
|breadth|The breadth of eggs in millimeters|
|species|Six species of birth species|

**Objectives**

- Import your data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize data using appropriate plots.
- Perform inferential statistical analysis to see if there's a difference in breadth of eggs laid by the bird species.
- Perform inferential statistical analysis to see if there's a difference in length of eggs laid by the bird species.
- Communicate findings in a report.
