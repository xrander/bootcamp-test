# Questions

1. create a vector of even numbers from 200 to 400 and save it in a variable called `my_even_number`. Print your result
```{r}
my_even_number <- seq(200, 400, 2)
my_even_number
```

2. How many even numbers do we have in `my_even_number`
```{r}
length(my_even_number)
```

3. create a vector of odd numbers from 30 to 108 and save it in a variable called `my_odd_number`
```{r}
my_odd_number <- seq(29, 108, 2)
```

4. what is the median of `my_odd_number`
```{r}
median(my_odd_number)
```

5. what is the average of `my_even_number`
```{r}
mean(my_even_number)
```

6. Using R, find the remainder of 498 divided by 5
```{r}
498%%5
```

7. Change the word **greatest** from lower to upper letter
```{r}
toupper("greatest")
```

8. Get the total value if you add `my_even_number`and `my_odd_number`
```{r}
sum(my_even_number, my_odd_number)
```

9. create a sequence of number from -10 to 10. and save it to the variable name `my_number`. Confirm if `my_number` data type is a character data type
```{r}
my_number <- -10:10

is.character(my_number)
```

10. If your answer in the previous is **TRUE** find the sum, else convert it to a character type
```{r}
sum(my_number)
as.character(my_number)
```
